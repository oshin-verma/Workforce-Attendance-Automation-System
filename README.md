# Workforce-Attendance-Automation-System

What the project is about

The goal of the project is to measure how effective different marketing campaigns are and help businesses understand where their marketing budget performs best. It analyzes customer behavior, campaign reach, spending, and purchase outcomes to generate actionable insights.

What problem it solves

Marketing teams often run multiple campaigns across channels but struggle to answer questions like:

Which campaign actually drives purchases?

Are we overspending on low-performing campaigns?

Which customer segments respond best?

What is the return on marketing investment (ROI)?

This project answers those questions using data.
